{
      after basic setup done
      run 
      `npx sequelize model:generate --name Booking --attributes flightId:integer,userId:integer,status:enum,totalCost:integer`

      now migrate the db
````````npx sequelize db:migrate````````
}

{
      good engineering problems 
      - if(two seats are booked for same flight)
      - if(user tries to book same flight twice)
      - if(one seat & 2 concurrent users try to book same seat)

      we need to handle concurrency issues
      - we can use locks
      - we can use optimistic locking
      - we can use pessimistic locking
      - we can use versioning
      - we can use optimistic concurrency control
      - we can use pessimistic concurrency control
      
}

{
      we need to handle ACID properties
      - Atomicity(we either want  to complete the statement or non of them  we  never want an intermediate state)
      states of transaction{
            -begin(when the state is just started)
            -commit(all the cahnges are applied successfully)
            -rollback(something happening in between  them  )
      }
      - Consistency(data stored in DB is always valid & in a concistent state )
      - Isolation(it is an abilty of multiple transactions to run concurrently without interfering with each other)
      - Durability(if something happens to the database, it should be able to recover from it)
      if any unfarseen circumstance happens we need to rollback the transaction


      transaction is nothing just a set of read and write operations



      begin has two parts{
            1.active{
                  1.partially completed{
                        commit 
                  }
                  2.failure{
                        rollback
                  }
            }
      }


}
{
      mysql provides locking mechanisms
      1.shared lock (this provides multiple transactions to read data at same time but restricts any of them to write on the data )

      2.exclusive lock (this prevents transactions from read or write the same at same time )

      3.intent locks(this used to specify that a transactions planning to read or write a certain section of data)

      4.row-level locks (this allows transactions to only a specific row)

      MVCC data base -> multi version concurrency data base
      mysql is compatible to allow multiple transaction to read or write data on same data 
      without much conflict
      
      Every transaction in mysql captures the data 
      it is about to modify at start of transction & writes the changes on entirly diff vcersion of data 
      THis allows transaction to continue working with original data without any conflict

      
}

{
      in booking system we use two types of concurrency controll to avoid race condition in DBMS

      1.prismistic concurrency controll({
            1.row level locks

      })
      2.optimistic concurrency controll({
            we can put manual checks for transactions

      })





}

{
      now do the interservice communication with flight-service-project & flight-booking-service

      both are running in different server
      {
            inter service communication :: we use axios in our service
            
      }
}

{
      we manually cancel our payment
      but if it is more than 5 mins then automatically the transactions would be cancelled
      to implement this feature we need 
      CRON _ JOBS --> read it from google ostechinix.com

      Node_cron package -
      `npm i cron-jobs`
      run {
      cron.schedule('*/30 * * * *', async () => {
            in every 30 mins it would cancel the old bookings

           await BookingService.cancelOldBookings();
      });
      }

}
-------- COMPLETED the 3 major ENGINEERING PROBLEMS-------------------------

{
      now new major issue
      client make a payment
      and payment got success 
      and while returning the response something went wrong
      client never recieve the notification that the payment make succefull
      and the end of client doing double transaction  for the same booking 


      another issue is that user make two payment request for the same bookings 
      one after another definitely the transaction will go happen

      concept callled as idempotency ==> {
            it is the property of certain operatin in math and CS where they can be applied multiple times 
            without changing the result beyond first applicatons


            lets say you made a payment request and the payment is done
            but by mistake one more request cameup {
                  only the first request will applied the 2nd request will not show any effect 

                  if(first request is not succesfull then then we definitely trying to apply the 2nd request)
            }

            idempotent api => for some error the 2nd request will come up and first request will succesfull
            we are not going to apply the 2nd one 3rd one and beyond that


            if somebody makes 2 payment request the payment will go through once

      }

      we have to send them idempotency key

      if payment actually went through we save the idempotency key inside our server
      before used it we will check the idempotency key is already there or not
}

package called uuid
`npm i uuid`

{
      where we stored our idempotency key
      we store it in reddis or in memory object 

}
